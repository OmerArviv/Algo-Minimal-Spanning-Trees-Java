# Algo-Spanning-Trees-Java

Minimal Spanning Trees:

1. (40 points) Write a function that receives a graph and a weight function (a list of nodes, edges and a weight for each edge) and returns a minimal spanning tree of that graph by running Prim's algorithm.

Clarifications:
A. The graph can be accepted as an argument in any way: vector, structure, etc.
B. Prim's algorithm must be implemented and no external source used.
third. The returned wood can be of any type.

2. (30 points) Write a function that accepts a minimum spanning tree (obtained in section 1), a newly added edge and its weight. The function updates the spanning tree with the addition of the new edge.

Clarifications:
A. Pay attention to the cases where the addition of the rib does not affect the minimum spanning tree
B. In case the rib affects the tree, it should be updated with the new rib and remove another rib accordingly.
third. The tree can be accepted as an argument in any way: vector, structure, etc.
d. The returned wood can be of any type.
God. Most important: No need to rerun Prim's algorithm, update the tree effectively.

3. (30 points) Write a main program in which the following functions are executed:

A graph must be created with at least 20 nodes, with at least 50 edges and weights. The graph must be printed. The form of printing can be in any understandable and clear format.

Find a minimal spanning tree (section 1) and print it. The form of printing can be in any understandable and clear format.

Create a new side and its weight, print it to the screen. This edge does not change the spanning tree.

The updated spanning tree must be found (section 2) and printed to the screen in a clear and understandable format.

Create a new side and its weight, print it to the screen. This edge does change the spanning tree.

The updated spanning tree must be found (section 2) and printed to the screen in a clear and understandable format.

Highlights:
It is allowed to use helper functions you wrote.
It is allowed to use mathematical libraries, I/O, etc.
You must not use external libraries that deal with graphs/trees.

Very important: comply with all the submission method requirements as specified in the model. Failure to meet the requirements will lead to a significant score reduction.
